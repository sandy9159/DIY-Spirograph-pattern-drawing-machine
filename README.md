Hello friends in this project video I have made a cool spirograph pattern drawing machine. the function of machine is very simple but this machine draw amazing curves and patterns on paper different set of combination of length of the arm and RPM of motors can nearly get infinite different patterns to draw on paper.

So what is Spirograph ?
Spirograph is a geometric drawing device that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The well-known toy version was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965.

The name has been a registered trademark of Hasbro Inc. since 1998 following purchase of the company that had acquired the Denys Fisher company. The Spirograph brand was relaunched worldwide in 2013, with its original product configurations

First of all I cut the 4mm wooden sheet in reired size like 150 x 120 mm
I used my mini tablee saw to cut the wooden sheet.
I have used birch paywood here becuse it looks nice and it is very strong in strength and easy to work with.

This 150 x 120mm wooden sheet became the base part of the machine and all the electronics parts will be mounte on this 
wooden sheet

Then I bring 4 150mm length of Alu. extrusion profiles. this profile have cross section of 20 x 20 mm and it have T slot

I used 4 90 degree bracket to join all four profiles together, in this way it will look like frame of alu extrusion profile.
Now I placed the previously cutted wooden sheet of 150 x 120 mm below to this frame and tight it with aluminium frame using T nut and bolt

After that I have used 4 rubber pads and placed all of then at the four corner of the frame, rubber leg is very importand for vibration free
functioning of machine.

Now I bring some BO DC motor which is going to be used in this project, BO DC motors are very powerfull and quit cheap to used in DIY projects

Bo motor (Battery Operated) lightweight DC geared motor which gives good torque and rpm at lower voltages. Here you can get bo motor with varying rated speed. This motor can run at approximately 200 rpm when driven by a single Li-Ion cell. Great for battery operated lightweight robots.

The motor has the ability to operate with minimum or no lubrication, due to inherent lubricity. The motor is ideal for DIY enthusiasts. This motor set is inexpensive, small, easy to install, and ideally suited for use in a mobile robot car. They are commonly used in our 2WD platforms.

Now I have solder the wire to the BO DC motor and placed both of the motor on the wooden sheet

I used 4 90 degree bracket to join all four profiles together, in this way it will look like frame of alu extrusion profile.
Now I placed the previously cutted wooden sheet of 150 x 120 mm below to this frame and tight it with aluminium frame using T nut and bolt



Pulse Width Modulation PWM controller. PWM is a technique in which the amount of current going in a circuit can be controlled by

chopping the Direct current using a gate or transistor that is changing its duty cycle( on-off time) you should see this article flashing of LED using 555 IC.

This PCB is to control the speed of a DC motor using PWM motor controller

This PWM circuit can be easily found in our daily life equipment like mobile chargers, laptop adapters, inverters

the power supply of desktop pcs, and in many other types of equipment in which steady low voltage is required.

We use DC motors like DC fans in many systems in our daily life. For example, to cool the system, in power supply, etc. Most of the time we have to control its speed according to the requirement.

There are many ways to do it. For example by inserting a series resistor to limit the current and hence limit the speed.

But this is not a good way because in doing so, much of the power is wasted in the form of heat.

If we use any microcontroller, then this is an expensive method that is not affordable and suitable for small motors.

That’s why we use PWM which has high efficiency and accuracy.

This is how place the PCB on the wooden sheet and placed a transparent 
acrylic sheet on it
This acrylic sheet will provide protection to the circut
as well as I have paced 2 potentiometer and one toggle switch on it 
In this way now its easy to used those electronics components

Now I have 3D printed some parts and cutted some more parts on my CNC machine.

3D printed yellow part is going to be placed on one top corner BO DC motor
slot on that part is used to tight bolt there and also we can place drawing arm on that

and other circular disc cutting on CNC Machine will be fitted on center one DC motor.

In this way machine construction is completed now we jaut have to place two white slotted arm
and one papaer on the circular disc. and switch on the switch the machine will draw cool pattern you love to watch it forever.
