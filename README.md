Hello friends in this project video I have made a cool spirograph pattern drawing machine. the function of machine is very simple but this machine draw amazing curves and patterns on paper different set of combination of length of the arm and RPM of motors can nearly get infinite different patterns to draw on paper.

So what is Spirograph ?
Spirograph is a geometric drawing device that produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The well-known toy version was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965.

The name has been a registered trademark of Hasbro Inc. since 1998 following purchase of the company that had acquired the Denys Fisher company. The Spirograph brand was relaunched worldwide in 2013, with its original product configurations

First of all I cut the 4mm wooden sheet in reired size like 150 x 120 mm
I used my mini tablee saw to cut the wooden sheet.
I have used birch paywood here becuse it looks nice and it is very strong in strength and easy to work with.

This 150 x 120mm wooden sheet became the base part of the machine and all the electronics parts will be mounte on this 
wooden sheet

Then I bring 4 150mm length of Alu. extrusion profiles. this profile have cross section of 20 x 20 mm and it have T slot

I used 4 90 degree bracket to join all four profiles together, in this way it will look like frame of alu extrusion profile.
Now I placed the previously cutted wooden sheet of 150 x 120 mm below to this frame and tight it with aluminium frame using T nut and bolt

After that I have used 4 rubber pads and placed all of then at the four corner of the frame, rubber leg is very importand for vibration free
functioning of machine.

Now I bring some BO DC motor which is going to be used in this project, BO DC motors are very powerfull and quit cheap to used in DIY projects

Bo motor (Battery Operated) lightweight DC geared motor which gives good torque and rpm at lower voltages. Here you can get bo motor with varying rated speed. This motor can run at approximately 200 rpm when driven by a single Li-Ion cell. Great for battery operated lightweight robots.

The motor has the ability to operate with minimum or no lubrication, due to inherent lubricity. The motor is ideal for DIY enthusiasts. This motor set is inexpensive, small, easy to install, and ideally suited for use in a mobile robot car. They are commonly used in our 2WD platforms.
